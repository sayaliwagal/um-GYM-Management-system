🏋️‍♂️ Gym Management System (MERN Stack)
📌 Project Overview

Payment receipts at many gyms are traditionally printed on paper, making them difficult to store, track, and retrieve. Gym owners also face challenges in manually notifying members about monthly fees, working/non-working days, and payment updates.

This Gym Management System is a web-based application that digitizes gym operations by securely storing member details, bills, and notifications online. It benefits both gym owners and members by improving transparency, efficiency, and accessibility.

🎯 Objectives

Digitally manage gym members and billing

Eliminate paper-based receipts

Automate monthly bill notifications

Provide role-based access (Admin / Member)
